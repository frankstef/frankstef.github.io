    <h2> Favorite CMSC subjects so far and why: My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 100 as front end is not really my strong suit and im really expecting to learn and improve within the duration of this course.</p>
    <h2> Favorite GE so far and why: My favorite GE so far is STS1 as the instructor was very kind and helped me learned a lot about Science, Technology and Society.</p>
    <h2> Favorite PL: My favorite PL so far is Python as it is very straighforward despite the errors that can happen due to wrong indentations and spaces.</p>
    <h2> Favorite food: As of now my favorite food is Ramen. I like the different flavours it has to offer and its an easy food to make due to the existence of instant ramens.</p>
